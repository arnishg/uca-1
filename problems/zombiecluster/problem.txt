There are n zombies in Seattle, and Liv and Ravi are trying to track them
down to find out who is creating new zombies — thus preventing an
apocalypse. Other than the patient-zero zombies (who became so by mixing
MaxRager and tainted Utopium), new people only become zombies after
being scratched by an existing zombie; for this reason, zombiism is
transitive. This means that if zombie 0 knows zombie 1 and zombie 1 knows
zombie 2, then zombie 0 is connected to zombie 2. A zombie cluster is a group
of zombies who are directly or indirectly linked through the other zombies
they know (such as the one who scratched them or supplies them with
brains).

Complete the zombieCluster function in your editor. It has 1 parameter: an
array of binary strings (i.e., composed of 0s and 1s) named zombies that
describes an n × n matrix of known connected zombies; if zombies[i][j] = 0,
then the ith and jth zombies do not know one another (otherwise, the cell
contains a 1 and they do know one another). Your function must return an
integer denoting the number of zombie clusters 

Output Format
Your function must return a single integer denoting the number of different
zombie clusters in Seattle. This is printed to stdout by the locked stub code
in your editor.
